Installation
======
You need to have the libmysql development libs installed. On Debian/Ubuntu, you
can do this by running: 'apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev'

Additionally, you should run 'make' in order to compile and install the custom
CSS files from the LESS sources as well as pulling down and installing the
project dependencies. You should only need to run 'make' when a change is made
to the LESS files.
